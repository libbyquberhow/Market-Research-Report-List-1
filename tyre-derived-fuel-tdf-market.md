<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tyre Derived Fuel (TDF) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shredded Tyre</li><li>Whole Tyre</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Tyre Derived Fuel (TDF) is produced from scrap tires and utilized as an alternative fuel source, primarily in industrial applications like cement kilns and power plants. The TDF market is categorized into two main types: shredded tyre and whole tyre. Shredded tyres are processed into smaller pieces, enhancing combustion efficiency and facilitating easier handling. Whole tyres, on the other hand, are used as-is, providing a more energy-dense fuel option but requiring specific equipment for effective combustion. Both types contribute to waste reduction and energy recovery.</p></p>
